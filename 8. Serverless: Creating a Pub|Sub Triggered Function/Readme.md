# Serverless: Creating a Pub/Sub Triggered Function

This exercise creates a Pub/Sub-triggered function named detect_language_pubsub that is triggered when a message is published to a Pub/Sub topic called user-input-text. The function must use the Google Translate API to detect the language in the Pub/Sub message. If the language is detected as English, the function publishes a JSON string (with text set to the received text string and src_lang set to the detected language) to a Pub/Sub topic called translated-text. If the language is not English, a JSON string (with text set to the received text string and src_lang set to the detected language) is published to the Pub/Sub topic called to-translate-text.

For example, assume your function detect_language_pubsub is subscribed to the Pub/Sub topic called user-input-text. On publishing a message with gcloud pubsub topics publish  user-input-text --message "Hello", the function must publish a message to the Pub/Sub topic called translated-text. On publishing a message with gcloud pubsub topics publish user-input-text --message "Moi kaikille", the function must publish a message to the Pub/Sub topic called to-translate-text.
