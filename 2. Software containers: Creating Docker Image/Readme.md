# Software containers: Creating Docker Image

This exercise introduces the basic concepts behind creating and running a container image with Docker. The goal is to create a container image by writing a simple Dockerfile.

In particular, the container will write the first five terms of the Fibonacci sequence, starting from zero and formatted as integer numbers separated by spaces. The sequence is generated by the shell script provided, which obtains the number of terms to print through an environment variable called VAR. The script will be copied into the container image.
