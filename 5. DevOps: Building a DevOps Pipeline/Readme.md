# DevOps: Building a DevOps Pipeline
This exercise introduces the concepts of DevOps pipeline especially Continious Integration (CI) and Continious Developement (CD), through a hands-on task using GitLab CI/CD tool, that is a powerful tool built into GitLab that allows you to apply all the continuous methods (Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment) to the software with no third-party application or integration needed. The goal is to develop a CI/CD pipeline for a given flask aplication on GitLab.

The task is to develop a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab for the provided flask application. This would entail writing python unit tests for the flask application as well as writing the configuration file for the GitLab CI/CD tool. The provided flask application returns a json containing { message: ‘Cloud Software and Systems’} and a response code 200. The second task is to write the config file for GitLab CI/CD tool to build the pipeline. In the build pipeline, you have to perform linting, testing, compiling, packaging, and installation of the provided application.
